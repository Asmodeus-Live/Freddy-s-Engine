## Freddy's Engine
This is a simple game engine for fnaf-like games. It works on lwjgl-opengl, but in future I will add lwjgl-vulkan. Now you can use this game engine only like a lib. Just copy "engine" package to your Java project and use Main class like a start point. Also it works on Java 21-LTS, so you need to get it.
